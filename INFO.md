## Objective
### Stater app
- Application will store yardages, suggest clubs, hold scores against par, and create handicap
    - User can input estimated yardages they reached. 
        - Percentage of swing and based on that the 100% yardage will be revealed. 
        - Input if downwing or against wind

## Challenges
- Finding and utilizing a golf api that gets different courses and gets the scorecard
- Expensive to get the actual yardages
    - so idea is to put in yardage and be given a suggestion
    - So may be more similar to a notepad
- Make this more mobile friendly


## Future Updates and Objectives can be 
- Playing with friend but just getting the scores. Having a season long score count
